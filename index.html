      <p>Hello and welcome!</p>

      <p>Mission-oriented Web Developer who tends towards backend development, looking to transition into the field from Human Services. My journey with code started years ago by R/R Studio and many, many algorithms -- “Rate My World” fulfilled a math requirement for my undergrad.</p>

      <p>After much prodding from people who know my strengths, I enrolled and completed the Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp at UMN. I’m obliging, eager to learn, a team player, and feel attitude is always most important. In whatever I do, I’m recognized for my accountability, detail orientation, ability to connect with people, and am excited to bring these values to my next opportunity.</p>
