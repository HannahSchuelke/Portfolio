      <p>Hello and welcome!</p>

      <p>Mission-oriented Developer looking to transition into the field after gaining a B.A. in International Studies and two minors in Dutch and Family Violence Prevention at UMN,  and working the last three years in Human Services. My journey in code started by R/R Studio and many, many algorithms -- “Rate My World” filled the math credit required for my undergrad. What I didn’t know then that I do know now, is how much this work of creating, testing, fixing, research, and analysis would suit me.</p>

      <p>After being prodded by many people close to me who knew my strengths, I decided on the Fullstack Coding Bootcamp at UMN. It’s been challenging, but also very fulfilling in that it is an environment of constant learning and teamwork, with specific mind to rules. While working in Human Services I was consistently recognized for my accountability, detail orientation, and ability to connect with people, and I’m excited to bring this to my next opportunity. As obliging, eager to learn, and a team player, I feel attitude is always most important with details a close second.</p>
